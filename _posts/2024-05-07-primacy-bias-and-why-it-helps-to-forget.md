title: "It's Time to Move On: Primacy Bias and Why It Helps to Forget"
description: "'The Primacy Bias in Deep Reinforcement Learning' demonstrates how the first experiences of a deep learning model can cause catastrophic memorization and how this can be prevented. In this post we describe primacy bias, summarize the authors' key findings, and present a simple environment to experiment with primacy bias."

## Introduction to Primacy Bias

Primacy bias occurs when a model's training is damaged by overfitting to its first experiences. This can be caused by poor hyperparameter selection, the underlying dynamics of the system being studied, or simply bad luck.
