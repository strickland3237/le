### A more open process

As with the previous edition of the Blog Post track, we forgo the requirement for total anonymity. 
The blog posts **must be anonymized for the review process**, but users will submit their anonymized blog posts via a pull request to the blog track's repository (in addition to a submission on OpenReview).
The pull request will trigger an automated pipeline that will build and deploy your post onto a website dedicated to the reviewing process.
<!-- The post will be merged into the staging repository, where it will be deployed to a separate Github Pages website.  -->
Reviewers will be able to access the posts directly through a public URL (generated by the Github action), and will submit their reviews on OpenReview.
Reviewers should refrain from looking at the git history for the post, which may reveal information about the authors.
